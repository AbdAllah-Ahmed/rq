Times
=====

Times is a minimalistic, super-small, Python library for dealing with date and
time conversions for once and for all.

It is simple, clear and designed to set a standard.

Armin Ronacher blogged about Python datetime best practices in his blog post
[Dealing with Timezones in Python][1].  The *tl;dr* summary is that everything
sucks about our mechanisms to represent absolute moments in time, but the least
worse of all (as in _an absolute moment in time_) in the universe is UTC.
